labrea
======

A rather buggy optimising brainf--k compiler. A successor to
[tarpit](https://github.com/jdpage/tarpit).

Compiling
---------

The distribution includes a shell script which invokes the labrea.scm file under
the Chicken Scheme interpreter with the appropriate arguments.

Do "make" to compile the programs in the examples directory. Both of the example
programs were taken from the [Wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brainfuck&oldid=470402810).

Extending the Compiler
----------------------

### Adding additional platforms

To add an additional platform, at the very least you'd need to add a code
generator. These are defined in stage Ï‰, and take the IR and convert it to a
kind of list-structured assembly representation.

If none of the supported assemblers (at this time, YASM, NASM, and GAS are
supported) targets your desired platform, you may need to add a new assembly
formatter which produces files suitable for your assembler.

Currently supported platforms are:

* xnu-amd64 -- 64-bit Intel Macs; 10.7+; some 10.6
* sysv-amd64 -- AMD64 SysV-compatible operating systems, such as Linux and
  FreeBSD (needs testing).
* ir -- Intermediate representation.

Support is planned for:

* sysv-ia32 -- x86 SysV-compatible operating systems, such as Linux and
  FreeBSD.
* sysv-arm6 -- ARMv6 SysV-compatible operating systems, such as Linux on the
  Raspberry Pi.
* winnt-ia32 -- Windows Native API-compatible operating systems.
* winnt-amd64 -- Windows Native API-compatible operating systems.
* dos16-8086 -- DOS-compatible operating systems.
* libc -- ANSI C output.
