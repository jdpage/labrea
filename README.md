A rather buggy optimising brainf--k compiler.

Compiling
---------

You should be able to compile Tarpit itself just by running make. If you want
to compile the programs in the examples directory also, do "make examples".

Both of the example programs were taken from the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brainfuck&oldid=470402810).
